# cplus
a guid for writing c program like cplusplus

At the beginning of this project, I want to write a c library for writing c program like c++, providing the keywords like 'class', supporting inheritance and so on. Ironically, when we I really start to implement what I think, it is hard and even impossible for me to make it just 
using the macro of c, and I want to take other ways, because the macro is simple and clear.
So, now I suspend this project. But I will write a guide for c to make it similar to writing object-oriented language program, such as c++.
